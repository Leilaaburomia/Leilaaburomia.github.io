As an Ecosystem Science and Sustainability student at Colorado State University, my goal is to align my professional interests in ecological research with my values to preserve our natural environment. Throughout my undergraduate career, I have supported my goal by receiving my environmental work experiences with a strong intention to learn. Conducting vegetation surveys, post-restoration wetland assessments, extensive bird monitoring, and working alongside professional biologists has created a strong skill set in field research. Being a logical and independent thinker contributes to my ability to solve problems. Overall, I seek to contribute my expertise in organizations focused on conservation science.
