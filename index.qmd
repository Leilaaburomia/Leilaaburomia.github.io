Hello, my name is Leila. I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at Colorado State University. I am studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a minor in Sustainable Water. Currently, I am interested in stream ecology and participating in ecological field work. During my free time I enjoy mountain biking and spending time with my cats!
