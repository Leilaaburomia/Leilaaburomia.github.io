Throughout my undergraduate career, I have supported my goal by receiving my environmental work experiences with a strong intention to learn. Conducting vegetation surveys, post-restoration wetland assessments, extensive bird monitoring, and working alongside professional biologists has created a strong skill set in field research. Being a logical and independent thinker contributes to my ability to solve problems. Overall, I seek to contribute my expertise in organizations focused on conservation science."
