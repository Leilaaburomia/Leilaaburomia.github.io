During the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. Our first laboratory assignment was to build a project website. Here is the link! <https://github.com/Leilaaburomia/Leilaaburomia.github.io>

In this assignment I learned how to...

\- render, commit, and push updates and changes to my remote repository on GitHub

\- change the theme and layout of my repository website page

\- add additional pages to my website to include other information
